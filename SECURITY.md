# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Simple Finance Dashboard application and provides guidelines for maintaining security.

## Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. **CRITICAL**: Encryption Logic Bug Fixed
- **Issue**: The Google Drive sync function had a critical bug where encrypted data was always stored as unencrypted
- **Fix**: Added proper conditional logic to handle encrypted vs unencrypted data paths
- **Impact**: Prevents sensitive financial data from being stored in plaintext on Google Drive

### 2. **HIGH**: OAuth Token Security
- **Issue**: Google Drive OAuth tokens were stored in localStorage without encryption
- **Fix**: All OAuth tokens are now encrypted using AES-256-CBC before storage
- **Impact**: Prevents token theft from localStorage access

### 3. **MEDIUM**: PBKDF2 Security Enhancement
- **Issue**: PBKDF2 iteration count was too low (10,000 iterations)
- **Fix**: Increased to 100,000 iterations to meet OWASP recommendations
- **Impact**: Stronger protection against brute force attacks on password-derived keys

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
- Comprehensive CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks
- Restricts script sources to trusted domains
- Prevents inline script execution except where necessary
- Blocks object embeds and enforces HTTPS upgrades

### 2. **Session Management**
- Secure session handling with automatic timeouts (30 minutes)
- Rate limiting for authentication attempts (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- Session data encrypted in localStorage
- Automatic cleanup of expired sessions

### 3. **Encryption Implementation**
- AES-256-CBC encryption for sensitive data
- PBKDF2 key derivation with 100,000 iterations
- Secure random IV generation for each encryption operation
- SHA-256 hashing for data integrity verification

### 4. **Data Protection**
- Financial data encrypted before cloud storage
- Secure token storage with encryption
- Memory-safe data wiping for sensitive information
- Database transactions for data consistency

### 5. **Build Security**
- Source maps disabled in production
- Console logs removed in production builds
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secure build configuration

## Security Best Practices

### 1. **Environment Variables**
- Use `.env.example` as a template
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use `VITE_` prefix only for client-safe variables
- Keep sensitive secrets server-side only

### 2. **Authentication**
- Implement proper session timeouts
- Use rate limiting for login attempts
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement proper logout functionality

### 3. **Data Handling**
- Encrypt sensitive data before storage
- Use HTTPS in production
- Validate data integrity with checksums
- Implement secure data export/import

### 4. **Development**
- Keep dependencies updated
- Run security audits regularly (`pnpm audit`)
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Enable security linting rules

## Security Monitoring

### 1. **Regular Audits**
```bash
# Check for dependency vulnerabilities
pnpm audit

# Check for outdated packages
pnpm outdated

# Run security-focused linting
pnpm lint
```

### 2. **Security Headers Verification**
Verify that the following headers are present in production:
- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

### 3. **Session Security**
Monitor for:
- Unusual authentication patterns
- High numbers of failed login attempts
- Session timeout violations
- Suspicious data access patterns

## Incident Response

### 1. **Security Incident Detection**
- Monitor console for security warnings
- Check for unusual session activity
- Watch for failed authentication spikes
- Monitor data export/import activities

### 2. **Response Actions**
```javascript
// Force logout all sessions
import { sessionManager } from './src/lib/security/sessionManager';
sessionManager.forceLogoutAll();

// Clear all sensitive data
import { SecurityUtils } from './src/lib/encryption/crypto';
SecurityUtils.secureWipe('all_sensitive_keys');
```

### 3. **Recovery Steps**
1. Identify and patch the security vulnerability
2. Force logout all active sessions
3. Rotate encryption keys if compromised
4. Notify users to change passwords
5. Review audit logs for impact assessment

## Security Configuration

### 1. **Production Deployment**
- Enable HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
- Configure proper CORS policies
- Set up security headers at server level
- Enable rate limiting at reverse proxy level
- Configure database encryption at rest

### 2. **Development Environment**
- Use HTTPS in development when possible
- Keep development dependencies separate
- Regularly update development tools
- Use environment-specific configurations

## Compliance Considerations

### 1. **Data Privacy**
- Implement data minimization principles
- Provide data export capabilities
- Support data deletion requests
- Maintain audit logs for compliance

### 2. **Financial Data Security**
- Follow PCI DSS guidelines where applicable
- Implement proper access controls
- Maintain data integrity verification
- Support secure backup and recovery
